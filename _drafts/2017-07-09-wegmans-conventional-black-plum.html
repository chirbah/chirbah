<b>tl;dr Wegman's conventional black plum, $2.49 / lb, sweetness = 1, juicyness = 3. Reccomend? No,  for the price, you're better off buying a peach.</b><br><br> <a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-TN4hUXpaldU/WWI8_D1lgWI/AAAAAAAAI2A/wP0OP6_NmrYfyNLfr19GL2f4EOkhiSh-wCLcBGAs/s1600/IMG_0541.jpg" imageanchor="1" ><img border="0" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-TN4hUXpaldU/WWI8_D1lgWI/AAAAAAAAI2A/wP0OP6_NmrYfyNLfr19GL2f4EOkhiSh-wCLcBGAs/s400/IMG_0541.jpg" width="300" height="400" data-original-width="1200" data-original-height="1600" /></a>  <br><br>I was encouraged by the fact that it looked like a butt.  <br><br>This morning I tasted a Wegman's conventional black plum. For those of you not in the "know", the term conventional means "not organic". It seems a bit loaded, term-wise, since being conventional is not really a sought after designation in this age of being "different" and "cool", but we'll leave these distinctions up to the fruit linguists.  <br><br><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-g7EjH0xV6wI/WWI9IALRPhI/AAAAAAAAI2E/CCAtClbrCRMbIZGhpaGhNzYHvD0pEhBogCLcBGAs/s1600/IMG_0542.jpg" imageanchor="1" ><img border="0" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-g7EjH0xV6wI/WWI9IALRPhI/AAAAAAAAI2E/CCAtClbrCRMbIZGhpaGhNzYHvD0pEhBogCLcBGAs/s400/IMG_0542.jpg" width="300" height="400" data-original-width="1200" data-original-height="1600" /></a><br><br>It was juicy, for sure. But not too sweet, and, unfortunately, a bit on the tart side. I can't really recommend this plum. Then again, it's my first plum of the summer, and I haven't yet tasted one that I liked.  <br><br> I ate it anyway in cereal. Don't you want to see pictures of my cereal? Look, another stupid food blog!!  <br> <a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-W-i2kKlMkcs/WWJA_gGb34I/AAAAAAAAI2Q/GCsV3O6dm-McRL8HjKFJES004o1RHiOBwCLcBGAs/s1600/IMG_0543.jpg" imageanchor="1" ><img border="0" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-W-i2kKlMkcs/WWJA_gGb34I/AAAAAAAAI2Q/GCsV3O6dm-McRL8HjKFJES004o1RHiOBwCLcBGAs/s320/IMG_0543.jpg" width="240" height="320" data-original-width="1200" data-original-height="1600" /></a>
