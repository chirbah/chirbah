War. Disease. Famine -- big problems. Problems people should be solving. Problems about life and death.

Not this blog's concern.

Here our concern is fruit. Those sweet things that hang from trees and bushes, that you put in your cereal, that you cook
and make a nice compote, or just eat outright.
 They are ostensibly healthy, but also contain sugar, which has recently fallen out of fashion.

If we are to eat these <em>modern day cigarettes</em>, we might as well eat the good ones.

That's where chirbah comes in.

At chirbah, we are solving the mealy apple problem. We all know what it's like to have a bad apple. To go to the store
 with high hopes of buying a sweet peach, and coming home with a lemon.

 The reality is that despite their outward appearance, and despite our best efforts at knowing their inner quality --
 the frantic tapping, sniffing, squeezing and shaking of fruit -- we fail time and time again to pick a winner.

 There is no substitute for the bite, the lick, the taste of the fruit you plan to buy -- and outside of farmer's markets, where
 the fruit is cut up and available for tasting, or certain grocery stores, where staff are happy to cut things up to let you try --
  -- eating first the thing that you want to buy is often not an option.

We at chirbah aren't satisfied with this state of affairs. We've been burned once too many times by the
siren song of sweetly smelling stone fruit -- only to be disappointed later when we eat it.

So, we (and the community of chirbah users and reviewers) are eating that fruit for you. We're making the bad face, eating the tart
peach, so you don't have to. We're in your community, in your grocery store, having the experiences you'd rather avoid -- and we're telling
you about it.

Now you know, at any given time, in any given place, which fruit to buy, and which to avoid.

Anyway, that's the grand plan. At the moment, it's only one person with a blog eating far too many fruit.

Hope you enjoy. You can find a little more information in my first post <a href="/welcome-to-chirbah.html">here</a>.
