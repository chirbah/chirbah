War. Disease. Famine. Big problems, aren't they? Problems people should be solving. Problems about life and death.

Not what this blog is about.

Here we're talking about fruit, kiddos. Apples, nectarines, peaches and plums. Watermelon, cantaloupe, kiwis and apricots. Nobody is dying. But hey, there's more to
life than death.

There's chirbah.

Here at chirbah, we are trying to solve an information asymmetry problem. Not unlike buying a used car, the current process of buying
  fruit is fraught with mystery, hijinks, and backroom deals. Not sure about those last two. But definitely mystery.

  Sure the fruit (or car) might look good. It might even smell nice. ut is it a good piece of fruit? Or is it a lemon.

  The reality is, despite all the tricks (tapping, sniffing, squeezing), there's no substitute for bona fide experience. You must eat the fruit
  to know the fruit.

  But by then, it's too late. We have a bad apple and it's spoiling the bunch!

  The good folks of chirbah say no more. They say, "No way, Jose!". They say give me your tired, your hungry, your desperate for quality fruit
  at good prices and we'll fix you right up.

  Chirbah is a website where people review the fruit they eat. They go to the grocery stores in your neighborhood
  and buy all the plums, from all the stores, and report the results.  Then you know which to buy, and which to avoid.

  Hope you enjoy the blog. You can find a little more information in my first post <a href="/welcome-to-chirbah.html">here</a>.
