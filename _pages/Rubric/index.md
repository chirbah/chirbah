How can we best evaluate fruit? Along which axes? As I've sunk deeper into the sweet,
 sticky mass of the fruit world, this question has come up.

"We need a texture column!", they demand. Or, "How about tartness?". Sweetness seems a given, but it doesn't really apply to avocados -- juiciness neither. Mealiness is important, but only really for apples.

Perhaps one set of criteria cannot rule them all.

As it's still the early days of chirbah, we chose to focus on three things:

    - sweetness
    - juiciness
    - would you recommend

They're not perfect, but they apply to most fruits we'd want to review, and you can skip them
when they don't.

We've created a range for <b>sweetness</b>:

| Rank | Sweetness      |
| ---- | -------------- |
| 0    | Not sweet      |
| 1    | Slightly sweet |
| 2    | Sweet          |
| 3    | Very sweet     |

And one for <b>juiciness</b>:

| Rank | Juiciness                                |
| ---- | ---------------------------------------- |
| 0    | Dry                                      |
| 1    | Some juice                               |
| 2    | Juicy                                    |
| 3    | Very juicy / dripping down my arm / eat over a sink |

And for <b>would you recommend</b>, it's either **yes** or **no**.

In the future we might enlarge the scope, but the comment section allows users to expand on their experience â€” about tartness, texture, or anything else they care to mention.
