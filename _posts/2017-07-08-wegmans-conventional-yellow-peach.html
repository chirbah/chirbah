<b>tl,dr: Sweet: yes, Juicy: 2, Sweet: 2, Price: $2.49/lb. Reccomend: You can do better for the price</b> <br><br> Tonight I ate a peach. I washed it, and then I laid it on my landlord's stained wooden cutting board and photographed it. For you dear readers, I took its pictures. Some people's religions forbid that kind of thing -- but I am the devoted type. <br><br>Anyway, I took its photo, as you see here. <br><br>  <a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-hLkmSBsOZnA/WWGbU7evYyI/AAAAAAAAI1Y/bQ5l_ZuwjTUk_0WoLwpOTkBk6FYED1-FACLcBGAs/s1600/IMG_0540.jpg" imageanchor="1" > <img border="0" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Dlfn0kegRa0/WWGbU-KBkLI/AAAAAAAAI1c/51kb39YrTngBZNfvNtTL4fkZQ5MqPnL0QCLcBGAs/s320/IMG_0539.jpg" width="240" height="320" data-original-width="1200" data-original-height="1600" />  </a><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Dlfn0kegRa0/WWGbU-KBkLI/AAAAAAAAI1c/51kb39YrTngBZNfvNtTL4fkZQ5MqPnL0QCLcBGAs/s1600/IMG_0539.jpg" imageanchor="1" ></a><br><br> This was a good peach. A peach we can appreciate. Not a peach you write your momma about. Not a peach you dream about. But a good peach nonetheless.  <br><br> It was sweety, but not terribly so. It had juice, but I wouldn't call it juicy. Still, if someone came up to me and asked me, "Josh, is that a good peach?", I would have no choice but to say yes.  <br><br> So, you can buy this peach. But at $2.49 / lb, you're better off going to Whole Foods and buying a local one (same price).  <br><br><a>  <img border="0" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-hLkmSBsOZnA/WWGbU7evYyI/AAAAAAAAI1Y/bQ5l_ZuwjTUk_0WoLwpOTkBk6FYED1-FACLcBGAs/s320/IMG_0540.jpg" width="320" height="240" data-original-width="1600" data-original-height="1200" />  </a> <br><br>
