description: How we evaluate our fruit
---

At the top of each fruit post, the reader might have noticed some numeric scores for sweetness and juicyness.
"Sweetness is a 2?", you might have asked yourself. "What could this possibly mean?"

Here at chirbah, we don't aim to be scientific, but we at least aim to be principled. This will likely
 be an evolving metric -- after all juicyness doesn't quite seem like the right criteria by which to evaluate an
 avocado -- so when we get there we will revise.

 But at the moment, here is our fruit scorecard:

<h3>Fruit Scorecard</h3>

<style>
table{
    border-collapse: collapse;
    border-spacing: 0;
    border:1px solid black;
    padding: 4px;
}

th{
    border:1px solid #000000;
    padding: 4px;
}

td{
    border:1px solid #000000;
    padding: 4px;
}
</style>


|Juicy|Sweet|
|--- |--- |
|4|Juice is running down your elbow|--|
|3|Juicy|Extremely Sweet|
|2|Conservatively juicy|Sweet|
|1|Some juice|Faintly sweet|
|0|Dry|Not sweet|


Admittedly, the system permits the user to use floating point values (i.e. 3.5s and 1.5s) when they are feeling
squishy, but generally speaking the reviews should adhere to the above notions of juicyness and sweetness.
