description: A quick review of three of the stone fruits on offer from Trader Joe's this summer

<b>tl,dr: Most of the stone fruit at Trader Joe's is not worth buying, but the saturn peaches are intriguing.</b>

I've got mixed feelings about TJ's stone fruit. On one hand, it's been pretty bad this summer.
On the other, the surprisingly bad quality inspired me to start this blog in the first place.

It's kind of how I feel about the other TJ too: yes, he was a great statesmen, but the dude owned slaves. It's either dry
nectarines or human chattel with these people.

I tried this same "Ripe & Ready" nectarine several weeks ago and it was similarly disappointing. These
things smell and feel great, but they are all water and no sugar. A few other stores
around town carry this brand, so take heed.

Same story here. Just not sweet.


### Trader Joe's Yellow Saturn Nectarine

After a frank conversation with TJ staff, I was recommended these saturn (donut) shaped peaches.

|Sweetness|Juiciness|Price|Recommend|
|---|---|---|---|
|Sweet|Slightly juicy|$3.49/four-pack|No|

These guys were sweet, but hard to know when to eat. The staff said that I should eat them
immediately, but they stayed hard the whole time I owned them.

The second peach had a really nice, unique sort of sweetness (different from a traditional
 yellow or even white nectarine). But -- still waiting for them to soften -- the ones
I ate over the next few days just got drier and drier.

Because these peaches were confusing, I can't recommend them. But I won't entirely write them off. I hope to eat
them again later in the summer.


<em>Honestly, I feel bad for all the TJ stone throwing. It's really one of my favorite grocery stores. And I'd like to say
there's no more to shade to be thrown on TJ's fruit, but unfortunately more bad news is on the way. Stay tuned,
 dear reader.</em>
