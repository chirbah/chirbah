description: A quick review of three of the stone fruits on offer from Trader Joe's this summer

<b>tl,dr: Most of the stone fruit at Trader Joe's is not worth buying, but the <a href="#trader-joes-yellow-saturn-nectarine">saturn peaches</a> are intriguing.</b>

I've got mixed feelings about TJ's stone fruit. On one hand, it's been pretty bad this summer.
On the other, the surprisingly bad quality inspired me to start this blog in the first place.

It's kind of how I feel about the other TJ: yes, he was a great statesmen, but the dude owned slaves. It's either dry
nectarines or human chattel with these people.

I tried this same "Ripe & Ready" nectarine several weeks ago and it was similarly disappointing. These
things smell and feel great, but they are all water and no sugar. A few other stores
around town carry this brand, so take heed.

Same story here. Just not sweet.

After an honest conversation with TJ's staff about deficits in their stone fruit selection,
 I was pointed in the direction of these fun little saturn peaches.
 They were sweet and had a unique flavour, but never got soft.

So I never knew when to eat them. I had one genuinely good one and three edible ones that dried up as I waited
for them to soften.

Because these peaches were confusing, I can't recommend them. But, I hope to give them another shot later this summer.

<em>Honestly, I feel bad for all the TJ stone throwing -- it's really one of my favorite grocery stores. And I'd like to say
that no more shade will be thrown on TJ's fruit, but unfortunately more bad news is on the way.</em>
