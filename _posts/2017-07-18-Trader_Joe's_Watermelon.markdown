<b>tl,dr: Trader Joe's Conventional Watermelon; Sweetness = , Juiciness = , Price = , Recommend = No</b>

This was an open and shut case really. I bought a nice looking watermelon from Trader Joe's, stuck it in the fridge for a few days, and then fed my colleagues. And they fed me ... an ear full of dissapointment.

There's a lot of black magic involved in the watermelon game. There's tapping (for hollowness), shaking (for juiciness), squeezing (for ripeness),
and sniffing (though I've been told this only works on canteloupes). 

As the skeptical sort, I don't really buy any of it. But if you disagree, and consider yourself some kind of expert in picking ripe watermelons,
let me know in the comments and I'll fund a 10 melon experiment. 

Anyway, as you can see below, the data speaks for itself:

### Sweetness

### Juiciness

### Recommend

Let this be a cautionary tale to you, dear reader. If you didn't know already, there are watermelons out there that don't taste good. What a world.
