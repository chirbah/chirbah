description: I'm exploring the meaning of ripeness

Self doubt is destructive. And yet, as I eat and review fruit for this blog, I second guess myself. If I eat a fruit and judge it to be bad, how can I know that its badness is a property of the fruit, rather than my failure to properly ripen it?

Just as Americans are guaranteed the right to a speedy trial by an impartial jury of their peers, so too should fruit be granted the right to be eaten, only when ripe, without prejudice … by other pieces of fruit.

Umm …

Great, now to the issue of impartiality. I do have biases, for sure, biased (toward Trader Joes, regretfully, and also Walmart, happily, but I try to be transparent. I further mitigate 



 do have my biases (against Trader Joe's and Walmart, at least), but I try to be transparent about them. And, when possible, I collect the opinions of fruit people beyond myself by soliciting the blind* opinions of my colleagues.

*They don't know the origins of the fruit until after the poll has been completed

I'm happy to interpret the constitution in ways that suit my agenda, so let's skip over the fruit cannibalism part and head straight to the issues of impartiality and speed. 

Well, maybe a bit of prejudice is ok — as long as we're transparent about it. If we're being honest about it, folks, the stakes in the fruit review business aren't terribly high. But I'll try, when I can, to collect the opinions of people beyond myself to blindly weigh in on the quality of fruit (as I've done <a>here</a> and <a>here</a>).

But the first threat is a lot harder to overcome — mostly, because I have no idea when fruit are ripe, or what ripeness even is. 

I hereby grant, All fruit are guaranteed, under the chirbah

it is written that all fruits are guaranteed, under protection of the Constipation, 



A lot of times when I eat fruit for this blog, and the fruit is not great, I sometimes wonder — is it the fruit or is it me?

As loyal readers of this blog will known, fruit (with the exception of bananas) are famously variable in quality and taste — which is why this blog exists as a useful source of information in the first place.

But despite all this variance, it's important that I don't contribute to it. It wouldn't be fair to the fruit. So if I buy a fruit and eat it too early, or let it sit on my counter too long and eat it late, I can't review that fruit in an honest way. After all, it was possibly my fault that the fruit was bad in the first place.
